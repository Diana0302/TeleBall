TeleBall Version 1.2 12/xx/14

* Bugfix: The "X" in the EEPROM menu was not always accessible.

* Bugfix: The pairing of two devices did not work, when one was in the won or
  lost state of BreakOut, while the other one was powered on. There were also
  some other states that prevented pairing, so this should be rock solid now.

* Bugfix: Tennis: If the game speed was set on the slave device, then when
  leaving the configuration menu, there was no short game pause and the balls
  position and direction was random, which sometimes lead to weird results
  like left/right bouncing balls.

* Bugfix: Tennis: When the slave device was the last to acknowledge to play
  tennis, then there was no delay, before the game started.

* Bugfix: Tennis: When the configuration menu was entered while the ball was
  still in pause mode (e.g. directly after a lost ball), then when leaving
  the configuration menu lead to a freezing ball, i.e. it did not start moving
  again at all; you needed to reset the match.



TeleBall Version 1.1 12/24/14

* Bugfix: BreakOut: When solving the game, i.e. when the third level is
  successfully mastered, the applause sound is played and the smiley face
  is shown.

* EEPROM: The device is now able to permanently store user preferences. For
  doing so, enter the advanced config menu by pressing the button 4 seconds
  while being in the standard menu. After configuring the paddle, you can now
  choose "square" for saving your preferences or "X" to revert back to the
  factory default values.
