TeleBall - Retro Handheld Game Console
======================================

What is TeleBall?
-----------------

TeleBall is a handheld game console. You cannot buy it. You need to build it
by yourself. It lets you play **BreakOut** in single-player mode using one
device and **Tennis for Two** in multi-player mode using two devices
communicating via radio.

TeleBall is pretty retro and very minimalistic: It features an
8x8 pixel LED matrix display, a paddle as game controller and one button.
Therefore, the range of possible games is limited but you will be surprised
how much fun and even zenlike meditation this kind of gameplay can bring you,
particularly when you play Tennis for Two with a friend.

TeleBall runs on 4 AA batteries. It features a Mini USB port for software updates,
that means, you can either run and update the build-in games on TeleBall or you can
create your own games using the [Arduino platform](http://www.arduino.cc). The source
code provided with the standard package is heavily documented, so it is a perfect
starting point for learning how to develop for TeleBall.

Playing TeleBall
----------------

Directly after you switch on your TeleBall, it starts in single player *BreakOut* mode.
