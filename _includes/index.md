What is TeleBall?
-----------------

TeleBall is a handheld game console. You cannot buy it. You need to build it
by yourself. It lets you play **BreakOut** in single-player mode using one
device and **Tennis for Two** in multi-player mode using two devices
communicating via radio.

TeleBall is pretty retro and very minimalistic: It features an
8x8 pixel LED matrix display, a paddle as game controller and one button.
Therefore, the range of possible games is limited but you will be surprised
how much fun and even zenlike meditation this kind of gameplay can bring you,
particularly when you play Tennis for Two with a friend.
