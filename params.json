It lets you play **BreakOut** in\r\nsingle-player mode using one device and **Tennis for Two** in multi-player\r\nmode using two devices communicating via radio.\r\n\r\nTeleBall is pretty retro and very minimalistic: It features an\r\n8x8 pixel LED matrix display, a paddle as game controller and one button.\r\nTherefore, the range of possible games is limited but you will be surprised\r\nhow much fun and even zenlike meditation this kind of gameplay can bring you,\r\nparticularly when you play Tennis for Two with a friend.\r\n\r\n![TennisOnTwoDevices](doc/tennis.jpg)\r\n\r\nAbout this GIT Repository\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nThis repository contains everything you need to build your own TeleBall\r\ndevice:\r\n\r\n* CAD .stl and .cmb.gz data for your 3D printer or for any online 3D print\r\n  shop to 3D print the TeleBall case\r\n\r\n* Eagle PCB layout for any online PCB manufacturer to make the TeleBall PCB\r\n\r\n* Part lists and hints how to build the hardware\r\n\r\n* Arduino source code to flash the firmware\r\n\r\nTeleBall is made using the\r\n[Arduino Nano platform](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardNano) on a\r\ncustom PCB.\r\n\r\nBrowse TeleBall's project page for a much better documentation, including a\r\nhow-to play and how-to build guide and a bill of materials (BOM).\r\n\r\n###Folder Structure\r\n\r\n    cad:    CAD data for 3D printing the TeleBall case\r\n            Use \".stl\" to modify the design or to create a custom output file.\r\n            Most online 3D print shops can use the \".cmb.gz\" for production.\r\n            Made with FreeCad: http://www.freecadweb.org\r\n\r\n    doc:    HTML documentation; use \"index.html\" in root folder to browse\r\n\r\n    eagle:  Electronic schematic diagram including PCB layout.\r\n            The libraries.zip files are only needed, if you want to modify\r\n            anything; otherwise you can just send the \".brd\" file to any\r\n            online PCB manufacturing company to receive a TeleBall PCB.\r\n            Made with the freeware version of Eagle: http://www.cadsoftusa.com\r\n\r\n    src:    Arduino source code aka Sketch in the subfolder \"TeleBall\".\r\n            Compile and upload it to your device using Arduino's IDE. You need\r\n            to install the libraries from libraries.zip first, before being\r\n            able to compile. The \"archive\" folder contains historic versions.\r\n            Made with Arduino: http://arduino.cc/de/Main/Software\r\n\r\nThe Makers\r\n----------\r\n\r\nTeleBall is brought to you by\r\n\r\n* [sy2002](http://www.sy2002.de): idea, code and original circurit design\r\n* doubleflash: additional circurit design and board layout\r\n* Miro: body housing/case\r\n\r\nTeleBall is a project of \r\n[MEGA - Museum of Electronic Games & Art](http://www.m-e-g-a.org).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
